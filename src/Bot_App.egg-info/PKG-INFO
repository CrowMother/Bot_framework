# Bot Framework

A Python library designed to facilitate the development of bots.

## Installation

Choose one of the following methods to install the Bot Framework:

**For local package installation:**

```bash
pip install Bot_App
```

**For development environment installation:**

pip install -e .
```

**For deployment installation:**

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CrowMother/Bot_framework.git
```

## Usage

This framework provides a structured approach to building bots. The main application code resides in the `Bot_App` directory, with source code in the `src` directory and tests in the `tests` directory. To get started, navigate to the `Bot_App` directory and run the main application file:

```bash
cd Bot_App
python main.py
```

Replace `main.py` with the actual entry point of your bot application.
